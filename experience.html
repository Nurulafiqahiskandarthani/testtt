            <h1>My experience of becoming a librarian prefect in secondary school</h1>
            <p>During my secondary year, I had the opportunity to gain a great deal of experience. Being a school librarian for almost 4 years was one of the best experiences I will never forget. Ha! You're probably wondering why I said that, because you might think being a librarian is boring and nothing to be proud of. To be honest, I don not really care what you think about it. It is because as what I know I have learned a lot of new things while functioning as a librarian at my school, I learned how to do every single job that the circulation counter do, process every materials such as books, newspaper, magazines, games, etc, available in the library, and arrange the materials according to its spesific subject and class number. Furthermore, I also able to enhance my soft skills in using the computer since much of our task require the use of it. As a result of the effort I showed during the several years of becoming the school librarian, I was selected to be the best prefect by my library teacher on the new prefect election day. I felt very happy and grateful at that time for being able to successfully complete my duties as a school librarian.</p>
